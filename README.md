# Serial Read via Website
## Description
This is a simple example how to implement `Serial.Read()` in NodeJS using [SerialPort]('https://serialport.io/') package. I use [ExpressJS]('https://expressjs.com/') to serve the HTML and send serial data to the web client by parsing it to JSON first.
## Requirements
* [NodeJS]('https://nodejs.org/')
* [Arduino IDE]('https://www.arduino.cc/')
* [ExpressJS]('https://expressjs.com/')
* [SerialPort]('https://serialport.io/')
## How to run
1. Download/clone the repo
2. Open terminal on the downloaded repo directory
3. Run `npm i` on terminal
4. Run `sudo npm start`
> This program hasn't been tested on Windows so you might need to figure out how to run it.
